Adds a image or flash movie to the page and after a delay show it lika a screensaver, blocking the page until some event happens.

Usage:
```
$.jscreensaver();```
or
```
$.jscreensaver({options});```

The default options are:
```
{
animationUrl: "../images/screensaver.gif",
delay: 5000,
docStrict: true,
events: 'mousemove mousedown keydown',
height: '100%',
textAlt: "Screensaver active",
type: 'image',
width: '100%'
}```

Hope you enjoy it!
